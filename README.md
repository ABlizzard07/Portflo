# About
Portflo was developed to make the transition into the college application process smoother for students. By adding their activities and classes and showcasing them for others to view throughout high school, students will be prepared to fill out activities and essays on CommonApp. Their portfolio will also help them apply for future work experiences and internships.

# Requirements
This app was built as part of FBLA's Mobile Application Development event. Our project meets the requirements in [this rubric](https://connect.fbla.org/headquarters/files/High%20School%20Competitive%20Events%20Resources/Individual%20Guidelines/Presentation%20Events/Mobile-Application-Development.pdf).
- Users can easily navigate between pages through our use of Stack and Tab navigators in React Native
- User interface is intuitive and instructions are placed to direct users when necessary
- Icons have been designed to fit with the theme of the app
- All user input is validated in both syntactical and semantical levels
- App directly works with the social media app Twitter to brag about activities

# Technologies Used
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) to test the app using hot reloading and managing the app's deployment
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) for the app's code, using both built-in and external libraries
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the app's components with efficient short-form classes
